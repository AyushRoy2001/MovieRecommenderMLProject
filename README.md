## *2. Description*
  -> I created an ML model for suggesting 5 movies according to the input movie.<br/> 
  -> Vectorization is the technique i used to convert the string of description, cast and other information to a vector<br> in a multi dimensional plane.<br/>
  -> Used Cosine Similarity to find out distance of the 5 closest vectors from the input movie vector in this project.<br/>
  -> The website where the model was implemented was made using Streamlit library of python.<br/>
  -> I replaced all special characters , commas, etc and convrted the text to lower case.<br/>
  -> Stemming was usedby me to convert the words to their base words for data processing.<br/>
  -> Saved the model using Pickle library in python.<br/>
 ## *3. Dataset*
  -> Two datasets are used for the project(credits and movies).<br/>
  -> the datasets are processed and merged for the required dataset.<br/>
  -> Datasets taken from Kaggle.<br/>
