## *2. Description*
  -> I created an ML model for predicting the win percentage of the chasing team for an IPL match.<br/> 
  -> Used Logistic Regression for this project.<br/>
  -> The website where the model was implemented was made using Streamlit library of python.<br/>
  -> Used Column Transformer and One Hot Encoder in pipeline for data processing.<br/>
  -> Saved the model using Pickle library in python.<br/>
 ## *3. Dataset*
  -> Two datasets are used for the project(credits and movies).<br/>
  -> the datasets are processed and merged for the required dataset.<br/>
  -> Datasets taken from Kaggle.<br/>
 ## *5. Contributers*
